Apply these if/else checks to make sure the summaries are following guidelines:

For a missing or empty section --> skip over the section and move onto the next section
Section summary becomes more than 50 words --> re-summarize so it fits within 50-word count limit
Unified summary word count exceeds limit --> Shorten to fit word count given by user
If output has extra sections (not present in the paper) --> delete the sections
If paper exceeds token limit --> inform the user that the paper is being truncated
