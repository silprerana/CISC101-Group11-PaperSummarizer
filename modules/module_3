Change Log: Adding two new conditions for summarizer 

Apply these if/else checks to make sure the summaries are following guidelines:

If evidence_mode = "strict,then The summarizer should: Only include claims, equations, and results that appear in the provided text.
If it cannot find enough information, it must say so explicitly
If section is missing / empty, then output “Section skipped: no usable text was provided.”
If section is too short (< 50 words), then “Section very short: summary may be incomplete.”

For a missing or empty section --> skip over the section and move onto the next section
Section summary becomes more than 50 words --> re-summarize so it fits within 50-word count limit
Unified summary word count exceeds limit --> Shorten to fit word count given by user
If output has extra sections (not present in the paper) --> delete the sections
If paper exceeds token limit --> inform the user that the paper is being truncated
